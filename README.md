Geometric-Stitching
===

##  Methodology

### 1. In-orbit geometric calibration (indispensable step)
- here with respect to the HY-1C UVI cameras.
- Aim: to obtain the precise imaging parameters of satellite cameras, with improving the interior and exterior orientation accuracy of satellite images.


### 2. Distorted virtual camera assignment
- The virtual camera assignment is the key link in the geometric stitching of the HY-1C UVI.
- The detector size difference between the virtual camera and the original cameras directly determines the GSD difference between the stitched image and the original sub-images.

### 3. Geometric stitching
