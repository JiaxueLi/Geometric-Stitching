## Background
the HY-1C UVI collects only ***a line image***.  
The UVI imaging procedure is likened to that a camera with a linear CMOS array on the ***focal plane*** collects images in a ***push-broom mode***.

## The geometric imaging model
- exterior parameters  
three rotation matrix (angles)
- interior parameters  
a look-angle model is often used to model the normalized detector coordinates
