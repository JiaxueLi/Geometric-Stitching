## Background
The ***detector size difference*** between the ***virtual camera***  and the ***original cameras*** directly determines the ***GSD difference***  between the stitched image and the original sub-images.

## Theoretical analysis [compared with undistorted virtual camera]
which resulted in a significant normalized detector size difference.


## Camera assignment
